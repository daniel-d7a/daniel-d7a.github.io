# js30-1-drum-kit

this is my attempt at the first project of the js30 projets, a js drum kit that works with mouse clicks, keyboard input, and touch on mobile phones.

the project is fully responsive for mobile phones and tablets.

Leave a star in GitHub, and hit me up on my socials if you liked the project (_and maybe have a job for me_)
